			<h3>About Us!</h3>
			<p>
				Jazba Jewelry is a handmade jewelry store that sells a variety of products including necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and bookmarks! The jewelry is a mix of my personal style and the current trends in
				fashion right now amoung teens/young adults. I plan to continue adding products as my business grows.

			<h3>History</h3>
			<p>Hi! My name is Preeti and I have been making jewelry for about 7 years. I initially gained interest when I was gifted a jewelry making kit. I quickly ran through the tutorials and wanted to learn more.
				 So, I decided to buy some jewelry making materials and followed YouTube tutorials. Now, I can say I've gained a better understanding of the jewelry making process and feel confident in my ability 
				 to make jewelry that is reflective of my personal unique style. 

				 I started my jewelry business in 2016 with my sister under the name Craft Infinity and sold jewelry and greeting cards at business fairs. Then in 2021, I opened under a different name during the pandemic to sell
				 jewelry and made many sales! Unfortunately, due to time constraints I had to shut it down temporarily, but I'm excited to finally open Jazba Jewelry!
